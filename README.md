# Neighbourhood_processing

( In Neighbourhood processing we work on each at pixel at a time depending on the neighbourhood pixels)

Neighbourhood Processing is basically done to remove Noise from an image using various filtering mask by performing 2-D convolution between input images's neighbourhood and various filtering Masks.

There are two types of filtering
  1. Low pass Filtering
  2.High pass Filtering

<p>
1. Low pass filtering
  
  <br>
  a. averaging method (It is used to remove Gaussian noise)
  </br>
  <br>
  b. median method (It is used to remove Salt & papper noise)
  </br>
