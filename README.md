# Neighbourhood_processing

( In Neighbourhood processing we work on each at pixel at a time depending on the neighbourhood pixels)

Neighbourhood Processing is basically done to remove Noise from an image using various filtering mask by performing 2-D convolution between input images's neighbourhood and various filtering Masks.

There are two types of filtering
  1. Low pass Filtering
  2.High pass Filtering

1. Low pass filtering
  a. averaging method (It is used to remove Gaussian noise)
  b. median method (It is used to remove Salt & papper noise)
